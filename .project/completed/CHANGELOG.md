## [2026-02-10] - [COST-PATTERN] Item 4: Pipeline Integration -- Hierarchy-Aware Module Generation

**Type**: Epic Item (COST-PATTERN Item 4)
**Duration**: ~1 day

### Summary
Integrated hierarchy-aware extraction (Items 2-3) into the full codegen pipeline. Virtual CalcUsage binding rewriting resolves `:>>` redefinitions (LITERAL, CHAIN, design deep-path) before the backtracker runs. Aggregation modules generate from `AggregationExpressionData` with symbolic channel resolution, multiplicity entry points, and `# source: aggregation` YAML comments. Extended CLI generation layer with aggregation module wrappers, auto-implementations, registry entries, and backlog reporting.

### Deliverables
- Pipeline Step 3.5: `_extract_hierarchy_and_rewrite_bindings()` in initialization.py
- Pipeline Step 4.7: Aggregation expression storage on `PipelineContext`
- Graph builder: `_build_aggregation_module()`, `_extend_output_catalog_with_aggregation()`, symbolic channel resolution
- Backtracker: `_resolve_from_aggregation_output()` strategy (Strategy 7)
- CLI: `_generate_aggregation_modules()`, `_generate_aggregation_stencils()`, registry and backlog extensions
- Generation: `_module_to_context()` aggregation comment, `generate_registry_function()` and `generate_backlog_report()` aggregation params
- 454 tests, 0 failures (141 new tests across 4 phases)

### Lessons Learned
- Computed attribute pattern provided clean template for aggregation CLI generation
- `ScopedAggregationData` with `module_eqn` property cleanly handled ADR-003 naming
- Deriving input names from `PipelineModule` (vs regex-parsing expressions) was the cleaner approach

## [2026-02-09] - [ATTR-EXPR] Attribute Expression Capture

**Type**: Epic
**Duration**: ~2 days (estimated: ~6.5-8.5 days)

### Summary
Enabled SysML modelers to express computations as attribute-level expressions (`attribute volume = pi * r^2 * h`) instead of requiring full CalcDef+CalcUsage ceremony. Codegen detects computed attributes on PartDefs, classifies them via a 5-way scheme (FORMULA, EXPOSE_PURE, EXPOSE_COMPUTED, LITERAL, UNRESOLVABLE), generates synthetic pipeline modules for FORMULA patterns, and auto-implements them using the Phase 1 expression compiler.

### Deliverables
- `ComputedAttributeData` model and 5-way `ComputedAttributeClassification` enum
- `extract_computed_attributes()` extraction module (Step 4.5 in pipeline)
- Graph builder extension for FORMULA synthetic module generation
- Backtracker computed attribute awareness (FORMULA -> MODULE_OUTPUT resolution)
- 21 E2E tests validating probe fixture (9 ground-truth values) and solar_battery `p_net_kw`
- ADR-004: Computed Attribute Pipeline Integration
- ADR-005: Computed Attribute Classification
- ADR-001 clarification (computed attribute entry points)
- ADR-002 amendment (FORMULA pattern exemption, modeling guidance)
- Full test suite: 285 tests, 0 failures, 0 xfail

### Lessons Learned
- Spike de-risked the entire epic with purpose-built probe fixture
- Phase 1 expression compiler reused with zero changes
- Option C (direct graph integration) cleaner than original Option A recommendation
- Chain handling was a non-issue (biggest simplification)
- ADR migration from monorepo should have been done during repo split

## [2026-02-08] - [EXPR-CODEGEN] Expression-Aware Code Generation

**Type**: Epic
**Duration**: ~8.5 days

### Summary
Built expression compiler that auto-implements CalcDef output expressions as Python code. 15/15 solar_battery CalcDefs, 19/21 CATF CalcDefs auto-implemented. Eliminated the `_impl.py` handwriting bottleneck.

### Deliverables
- Expression compiler (`expression_compiler.py`)
- Auto-implementation template (`auto_implementation.py.jinja2`)
- Step 6.5 pipeline integration
- 167 tests, 0 xfail

### Lessons Learned
- CalcDef-agnostic compiler design enabled reuse in Phase 2 (ATTR-EXPR) with zero changes
