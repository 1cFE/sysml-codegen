## Active Work

### docs-scrub — CERTIFIED (awaiting PR after the epic merges)
Post-epic coherence pass over `docs/architecture/` on branch `docs-scrub` (off
`upstream-findings-epic`): 31 docs verified/corrected against HEAD; matrix now
248 = 236 PASS + 12 UNTESTED (SNAP/NC/REG rows added); thin docs 07/10/11/17/24
closed; 22/23 verified live, 26 marked Historical; gate byte-identical
(1989/4/5, ruff 21, mypy 109). Independent audit: Certify (3 gaps found+cured).
Follow-ups filed: BACKLOG DOCS-SCRUB-F1..F4 (F4 = resolve_input() has zero
production callers while its REQs are marked PASS). Artifacts:
`.project/active/docs-scrub/{spec,plan,fact-sheet,audit}.md`. PR this branch
separately once PR #3 merges.

### UPSTREAM-FINDINGS Epic — COMPLETE (awaiting PR review/merge)

All 12 items landed and audited PASS on branch `upstream-findings-epic`
(orchestrated run, 2026-07-05..06). PR: https://github.com/1cFE/sysml-codegen/pull/3

**One action for the human**: the companion agentic-mbse PR. Branch
`upstream-findings-sync` is pushed to origin (6 commits); the prepared PR body is
committed at `.project/active/AGENTIC_MBSE_PR_BODY.md` — create with:
`gh pr create --repo 1cFE/agentic-mbse --base main --head upstream-findings-sync --title "UPSTREAM-FINDINGS sync: validation checks + guidance for the newly supported subset" --body-file .project/active/AGENTIC_MBSE_PR_BODY.md`

Post-merge follow-ups already filed: BACKLOG P1 (remaining 10 fusion-tea
cross-part bindings), the stale-fixture drift chore, C7/C8/F6 in agentic-mbse's
backlog, and the fusion-tea coordination notes in the three release-notes files.


## Recently Completed

### 2026-02-17: Phase 5 — E2E Pipeline Validation (5.2) — Checkpoint 5
- 16 conformance tests in `tests/conformance/test_pipeline_e2e.py`
- catf_mfe baseline generated: 42 modules (all CalcUsage), 8 EP groups
- Baseline comparison for all 4 models (solar_battery, catf_mfe, chain_spike, attr_expr_probe)
- REQ-PIPE-01 through REQ-PIPE-06 validated end-to-end
- Checkpoint 5: All 4 models match baselines — refactored pipeline composes correctly
- No production code changes — conformance-only

### 2026-02-17: Phase 5 (partial) — Orchestrator Step Ordering (C19)
- 39 conformance tests in `tests/conformance/test_orchestrator.py`
- Static analysis: `build_pipeline_context()` 10-step DAG ordering verified
- FORMULA removal safety net verified (zero natural overlap in fixtures; constructed overlap exercises logic)
- Registry 4-phase ordering: all aliases target Phase 1 canonical channels (solar_battery + catf_mfe)
- Pipeline invariants (PIPE-01–06) verified across 4 models (solar_battery, catf_mfe, chain_spike, attr_expr_probe)
- REQ-PIPE-07 baseline: 9 generation/ files import from extraction/analysis (Phase 7.6 target)
- No production code changes — conformance-only

### 2026-02-17: Phase 4 — Module Factory + Graph Assembly
- C14 CalcUsage Factory (48 tests), C15 FORMULA Factory (34 tests), C16 Aggregation Factory (32 tests)
- C17 Entry Point Classification (35 tests), C18 Graph Assembly (34 tests)
- Checkpoint 4 baseline comparison: solar_battery, chain_spike, attr_expr_probe match Phase 0 baselines
- All 3 module types verified (CalcUsage + FORMULA + Aggregation)
- Baseline normalization documented: CalcUsage compilability (snapshot serialization boundary), parameter ordering (dict iteration order)
- All design doc amendments applied (06-entry-point-classifier.md, 11-analysis-backtracker.md)

### 2026-02-17: Phase 3 — Analysis Components
- C11a Backtracker Conformance (43 tests), C11b Typed Dispatch Migration (17 tests)
- C12 Input Resolver (26 tests), C13 ParameterGroupDeriver (30 tests), X02 Dual Resolution (20 tests)
- Backtracker fully migrated to typed dispatch: scoped_lookup/sysml_qn_lookup/alias_lookup
- `_compat` dict, `resolve()`, `register()` removed from OutputRegistry
- 14 previously compat-only resolutions (12 catf_mfe + 2 solar_battery) now typed
- D3: Static analysis helpers extracted to `tests/helpers/static_analysis.py`

### 2026-02-17: Phase 2 — Core Infrastructure Spikes
- C08 Output Registry (32 tests), C09 Virtual Binding Rewrite (38 tests), C10 Aggregation Scoping (47 tests)
- 5 NewType wrappers + 3 typed registries implemented
- Phase 2 audit: 6 fixture coverage gaps investigated (C1-C6), 4 closed, 1 partially closed, 1 pending

### 2026-02-17: Phase TRR — Typed Registry Refactor (Design Docs)
- All 8 TRR design doc updates applied (docs 03, 04, 09, 10, 11, 15, 24, 27)
- New design intent doc: `27-typed-registry-refactor.md`

### 2026-02-17: Phase 1 — Foundation & Extraction Components
- C01-C07, all 49 requirement IDs verified

### 2026-02-17: Phase 0 — Test Infrastructure & Baselines
- Extraction snapshots for 6 models, pipeline baselines for 4 models

### 2026-02-10: COST-PATTERN Items 1-4
- Hierarchy-aware codegen: templates, redefinitions, aggregation, pipeline integration
